# Machine Learning Capstone Project
## 1. Introduction

Financial problem is one the serious problems that may drag people from heaven back to earth. For example, some people may quit college because of the tuition or supporting the family. We may realize that a term deposit which is like a self-funded insurance and a back-up plan may help avoid or reduce the influence of them.

We would like to build classifiers based on supervised learning algorithms to make classification about if a client has subscribed a term deposit. We also would like to analyse the relationship of different features, and if the observations can be clustered into several groups.

The dataset is obtained from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing) and contains 45211 observations and 17 variables (including response and predictors).
